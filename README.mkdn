  ## The Research, development, frustration, please work, Branch<br/>
  ### This branch may not build, may burn up your device, or even grab nuclear launch codes. This branch is made to help the          headaches of merging and rewriting code as needed to try and keep the n6 going past its EOL.<br/><br/>                    Use the 81x branch for stable builds.
